# PistonUpdateReducer 
- used for reducing the block update frequency of pistons, very useful for bamboo farms in specific with combination of AnarchyExploitFixes's item limit. **requires paper 1.20.6+** or you could lower the api version yourself (not recommended)
# permissions
- pistonupdatereducer.command.base: /pur
- pistonupdatereducer.command.reload: /pur reload
# issues
- does break 2 pistons put directly against each other kind of farms (like pickle farms) but this shouldn't be an issue as there are block whitelist 
# compiling 
- clone the repo, and then type `./gradlew build` or `gradlew.bat build`
